// A  trivial Code where All the Clang version , LLVM source repo , commit hash and target information is only being printed when the 
// given variable from terminal is not there in the code. i.e our code works even when the variable is not given. for example 
// goven variable is temp from terminal
int foo ( ) 
{
	int i =10 ;
	i = i+10;
	{
		int i = 400;
	}
